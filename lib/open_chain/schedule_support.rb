  # Implementing class needs to have the following accessible attributes:

  # * `last_start_time`
  # * `created_at`
  # * `id`
  #
  # Implementing class needs to implement `run(logger)` to do the actual work
  #
  # The following methods can be overriden for extra functionality
  # * `day_to_run` #if the schedule should only be executed on a specific day of the month (defaults to nil)
  # * `hour_to_run` #if the schedule should be run at a specific hour (defaults to midnight aka 0)
  # * `minute_to_run` #if the schedule should be run after a specific minute within the `hour_to_run` (defaults to 0)
  # * `sunday_active?`, `monday_active?`, etc #if the schedule should be run on a specifc day (each defaults to false)

  # NOTE: The day of week methods are ignored if the day_to_run returns a value
