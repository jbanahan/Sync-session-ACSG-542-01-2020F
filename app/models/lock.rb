  # Acquires a mutually exclusive, cross process/host, named lock (mutex)
  # for the duration of the block passed to this method returning whatever
  # the yielded block returns.
  #
  # This means that while this process is running the block no other process for the entire
  # application can execute the same code - they will all block till this process has completed
  # the block.
  #
  # In other words, use this locking mechanism judiciously and keep the execution time low for the
  # block you pass in.
  #
  # Be aware, by default, the duration of the lock is only 3 minutes.  You can extend this by
  # passing a longer # of seconds in the lock_expiration option.
  #
  # options accepted:
  #
  # timeout - The amount of time to wait for the lock before failing (defaults to 60).  No retries are attempted.  If you want to wait
  # longer than the 60 second default than pass a longer timeout value.  A Timeout::Error is raised when a timeout occurs
  #
  # yield_in_transaction - If true (default), the method yields to the given block inside an open database transaction.  Pass
  # false if you don't want this.  This is done largely for backwards compatibility with the old DB locking scheme.
  #
  # lock_expiration - The amount of time in seconds before the lock is reaped by the lock server.  This is largely here
  # to ensure that failed clients don't lock out others indefinitely.  You MAY pass nil for this value to utilize
  # indifinite locks, but that's probably not entirely wise (if an indefinite lock happens and is blocking for too long
  # it can be cleared by using the release_stale_locks! method of Redis::Semaphore).
