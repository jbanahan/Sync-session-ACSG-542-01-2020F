# To install the script for upstart purposes, run the following command:
# sudo cp chainio-web.conf /etc/init/chainio-web.conf
# sudo chmod 644 /etc/init/chainio-web.conf
#
# This script is not intended to be run directly by the upstart process.
#
# The chainio.conf upstart script will run it if the EC2 instance it is running 
# on has a Role tag w/ a value of 'Web'.
#
# This script will NOT run unless this instances is tagged with a Role of 'Web'.
# 
# NOTE: Due to the way Nginx/Passenger work by spawning lots of child processes, 
# the service cannot effectively be monitored and restarted by upstart.  
# As such, if the server crashes then you will have to re-issue
# the start command to restart it (or configure some sort of watchdog to do so).
#
# sudo start chainio-web
